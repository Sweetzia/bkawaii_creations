BKawaii Creations - Marjolein van Leeuwen
------------------------------------------
**Full Stack Frameworks with Django**

This is my 4th Milestone project for Code Institute. I build a fictional e-commerce web application called Bkawaii Creations. ‘Kawaii’ means Cute or Lovely in Japanese. With this web application I sell my own personal handmade Kawaii Facemasks and Nail Art products.

By creating this web application , I want to show my skills in building a e-commerce website. It is a growing market and e-commerce web applications are getting more and more in demand.
This e-commerce web application is complete with:
* product search and filter functionality.
* A functional payment system.
* A full-featured authentication system including email confirmations and user profiles.
* Real-time notifications that guide the user's experience.
* And give store owners the ability to add, edit and delete products in the online store.

**User stories**

User stories
* As a user : As a new visitor to BKawaii Creations, I want the page to be easily navigated.
* As a user:  I want clear instructions on how to view all the products and categories. 
* As a user: I want the web application to respond quickly to my interaction.
* As a user: I want a search option so I can quickly find the product I'd like.
* As a user: I want to be able to purchase these products easily, and pay for them online.
* As a user: I want the payment service to be easy and clear.

4. Products template to view the products and product details

Challenges

I worked with Git branches for the first time in this project. It was difficult at first and I got scared merging my git branches to my master branch. I was afraid my code would not work anymore. But with the help of this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2TUommS3O0  everything went well with merging my git branches, until I encountered a problem when I went merging my profiles branch to my master. Is was a merge conflict with my binary file db.sqlite3. 
I could not resolve the conflict in github with a pull request.
So I searched for a solution on google and finally discoverd this tip on https://lostechies.com/joshuaflanagan/2010/01/29/how-to-resolve-a-binary-file-conflict-with-git/
I had no git merge conflicts anymore and my profiles app was added to my master branch. The only thing was, that I had to create a new superuser to gain access to my django administration.
