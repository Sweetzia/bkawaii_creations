BKawaii Creations - Marjolein van Leeuwen
------------------------------------------
**Full Stack Frameworks with Django**

This is my 4th Milestone project for Code Institute. 
I build an e-commerce web application called Bkawaii Creations. ‘Kawaii’ means Cute or Lovely in Japanese. On this web application I sell my own handmade  kawaii facemasks, scrunchies and press-on nails with nail art. 

By creating this web application , I want to show my skills in building a e-commerce website. It is a growing market and e-commerce web applications are getting more and more in demand. 

This e-commerce web application is complete with:
- product search and filter functionality.	
- A functional payment system.
- A full-featured authentication system including email confirmations and user profiles.
- And real-time notifications that guide the user's experience.
